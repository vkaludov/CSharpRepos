The main difference between C Sharp and .NET framework is that .NET is an application development framework, that contains numerous libraries containing a range of functionality and C# is a strong object-oriented programming language that is mostly build on the .NET framework. In .NET we don't find only C#, but also Visual Basic for instance. So basically .NET is not only a library but a runtime for executing applications and you can use several languages one of which is C# to write a .NET application.
